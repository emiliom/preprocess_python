# preprocess_python
This is a location for python code used to acquire and format data for a SnowModel run. 

## The notebooks should be completed in the following order for each modeling domain:

####       1. DomainBounds_2json.ipynb
Notebook to create a JSON containing bounding parameters for all modeling domains. Add new domains here. 

####       2. Fetch_SNOTEL_CSO.ipynb
Notebook to get SNOTEL station data within a modeling domain.

Files saved out:
* .geojson of SNOTEL stations within modeling domain
* .csv of swe and snow depth data for SNOTEL stations over time period of interest

####       3. Build_SnowModel_line_file.ipynb
Notebook to create files to run SnowModel in line mode for calibration.

Files saved out:
* snowmodel_line_pts.dat
* .asc of line dem values
* .asc of line veg values


## (optional notebooks)

####       Baseline_par2json.ipynb
Notebook to extract .par values and save them to a JSON. 

####       Explore_SNOTEL.ipynb
Notebook to examine SNOTEL stations within a modeling domain.

####       Extract_data_from_raster.ipynb
Notebook to extract raster values at SNOTEL locations.

####       Set_baseSM.ipynb
Notebook to set the SnowModel .par file to baseline values.
